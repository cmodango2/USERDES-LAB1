I am Cheska Janine Odango but you can call me Cheska for short. I'm born on June 3, 2000 and yes! I am 20 years old stunning. I Graduated my Senior Highschool in Sta. Clara Parish School in Pasay City.
Currently, I'am taking my Bachelors Degree in Information Technology at Asia Pacific College.
I chose this course because I find IT as an interesting field of learning and growth.
Also, it has a wide range of opportunity because as the time goes by technology are getting smarter and advance

I love to join beauty pageants because aside of being a successful developer, I also dreamed to be a Beauty Queen someday.
When it comes in my specialization, I used to create a simple mobile application in my Data Structure class.
So that I learned some of the basic programming in python and java language.
I am interested too in discovering and testing unfamiliar applications for my own satisfaction.
I'm inlove with an applications that has good UI and UX, so that I keep them in my smartphone.
Also, I love to design graphics and use it as my marketing tool to promote my Online Shop.
And yes! it helps me a lot in attracting customers in my social media accounts.
Big Thanks to this subject, now I can learn more in in terms of creating a good UI and UX.
And I will apply all my learnings in this subject to my future projects and Application Development.
